# HD-VG-130M Dataset

This is the dataset from the paper ["VideoFactory: Swap Attention in Spatiotemporal Diffusions for Text-to-Video Generation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10874), Wenjing Wang, Huan Yang, Zixi Tuo, Huiguo He, Junchen Zhu, Jianlong Fu, Jiaying Liu.

We curate a large-scale video dataset called HD-VG-130M. This dataset comprises 130 million text-video pairs from the open-domain, ensuring high-definition, widescreen and watermark-free characters.

UPDATE: We have created a new higher-quality 40M subset, taking into account text, motion, and aesthetics. This subset will be released soon.
